# Introduction

Here I pull together a dataset of remeasured trees from the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) records for the Northern Forest region, which will allow us to build sugarbush tree growth, mortality, and ingrowth models. It will be filtered to only include subplots with sufficient sugar maple stocking such that they could be viable sugarbushes. We would like to have at least 3 measurements for each subplot (they're remeasured about every 5 years) but also would like to only use data that was collected using the current standard plot design, which was created in the mid 1990s. At least 3 measurements for each subplot will allow us to build an ingrowth/regeneration model that accounts for logging removals that were made ahead of time. (As in, we see how much basal area was removed from year 0 to year 5, which will become a predictor for ingrowth that happens between years 5 and 10, and maybe also for ingrowth between years 10 and 15.) I'll see how many plots there are with 3, 4, and 5 measurements, and how ingrowth changes through time following a logging operation, and then We can decide how many measurements to use for the ingrowth model. We expect to use dbh, bal, and previous logging removals as independent variables for all the models.

The Northern Forest region was chosen because it covers a fairly large geographic extent while still representing a coherent ecological region, in which trees can be expected to follow a similar set of behaviors. Models developed with the dataset should be relatively unbiased for individual sugarbushes within the region, while still being trained on enough data (we hope) to paint an accurate picture. The US Northern Forest is defined here as including Oswego, Oneida, Lewis, Jefferson, Saint Lawrence, Herkimer, Fulton, Hamilton, Franklin, Essex, Clinton, and Warren Counties in New York; Franklin, Orleans, Essex, Chittenden, Lamoille, Caledonia, Washington, Addison, Orange, and Grand Isle Counties in Vermont; Coos, Grafton, and Carroll Counties in New Hampshire; and Oxford, Franklin, Somerset, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Waldo, Hancock, Washington, Penobscot, Piscataquis, and Aroostook Counties in Maine.

# Methods

FIA tree, plot, condition, and GRM data are downloaded from the FIA DataMart^[https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/datamart.html] in the form of state-specific csv files, which were generated by the Forest Service from the FIA Oracle database tables. Most of the necessary data is from the trees table, but the conditions table has some useful site information and the plots table has measurement dates and plot IDs that we'll need. The GRM table has growth data, which is mostly modeled. I think we don't want any of that, but I can't remember, so we'll download it in case and probably discard it later. 

Potentially useful fields are retained in all the tables. In the trees table, seedlings with diameters measured at the root collar instead of at breast height get thrown out right off the bat, since they're hard to work with alongside the data from larger trees. All the downloaded data are current as of `r format(Sys.Date(), format = "%B %d, %Y")`.

## SUBPLOTS MATTER!!!!
# Subplots may have different sizes depending on the plot design, found in
# PLOT$DESIGNCD (see database guide, appendix i)
# I can just keep DESIGNCD == 1 (the main standard) and lose some data,
# or I can account for the various designs when I calculate TREE$ba_ac
# (above; which would mean calculating ba_ac after combining
# states' data and joining nf_trees to nf_plots).
# Update: it's probably harder b/c they severed the plot codes to older
# inventories to keep people from seeing real coordinates

# DESIGN CODES:
# 1:4 used 1999 - present
# 11:15 used 1994 - 1996
# 100 used 1982 & 1983
# 101:104 used 1991 - 1998
# 101 was continued through 2008
# 105:120 variousy used 1991 - 1993

# Calculate BAL & plot BA for each tree
################################################################################

# Calculates overtopping basal area (BAL) assuming all input trees are in
# same plot and ba is adjusted based on tpa:
pbal <- function(dbh, ba){
  sapply(dbh, function(x){
    index <- dbh > x
    return(sum(ba[index]))
  })
}


# Add BAL
nf_trees <- nf_trees %>%
  mutate(bal = NA,
         ba = NA)

# Note that this only calculates ending basal areas for trees that lived
nf_trees[nf_trees$STATUSCD == 1,] <- nf_trees[nf_trees$STATUSCD == 1,] %>%
  group_by(PLT_CN, SUBP) %>%
  mutate(bal = pbal(DIA, ba_ac),
         ba = sum(ba_ac, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Some of the variables retained from the FIA tables were recorded in the field, while others were determined remotely by the FIA Program. I also calculate plot basal area and tree overtopping basal area here after the fact, by grouping trees into their respective plots and subplots.

To start, I'll sort out 5 measurements for each plot, working backwards in time and only keeping records from earlier measurements in plots that can be linked to later measurements: 

```{r multiple_measurements}
################################################################################
# Make linkable tables for multiple measurements
################################################################################

# make ending data, which will be used to find data from earlier measurements of
# the same subplots (but note that this can contain multiple measurements from
# the same subplot; for a plot that's been measured 4 times, we'll get four
# different 'records' in this table, three of which will have PREV_PLT_CN. Most
# or all of these multiples will be filtered out later when we remove plots with
# insufficient measurements, depending on how many measurements we decide to
# use.)

Now we can explore data available for the ingrowth model, by starting with subplots that have been measured five times, filtering out non-sugarbushes, seeing how much data is left, seeing how many plots had some logging, and doing a cursory exploration of ingrowth patterns through time. Based on what we find, we can decide weather to keep the oldest data for the model creation, or discard it and start over with the next oldest. Potential sugarbushes (which we'll keep in the data) need to have at least `r bamin` sqft/ac ba, at least `r pcthm`% of ba in hard maple, and a site class not over `r maxsite` (growing at least 50 cuft/ac/yr; VT class II or better).

There are `r length(sugar_plots)` potential-sugarbush subplots with at least 5 measurements, of which `r sum((sugar5 %>% group_by(sub) %>% summarize(cutting = any(cut_01)))$cutting)` had at least some cutting during the first remeasurement period (from measurement 0 to measurement 1). Here is the average ingrowth (stems/subplot) in different remeasurement periods for plots that had some logging in the first period, and plots that had no logging:

```{r sugar5_ingrowth}
# plot ingrowth by time in plots w/ & w/o cutting
sugar5 %>% group_by(sub) %>% 
  summarize(cutting01 = any(cut_01), in01 = sum(ingrowth_01), 
            in12 = sum(ingrowth_12), in23 = sum(ingrowth_23),
            in34 = sum(ingrowth_34)) %>% 
  group_by(cutting01) %>% 
  summarize(nplots = n(), ingrowth01 = mean(in01), ingrowth12 = mean(in12), 
            ingrowth23 = mean(in23), ingrowth34 = mean(in34))
```

There's some evidence of increased ingrowth in the remeasurement periods following logging (ingrowth12, ingrowth23, and ingrowth34), but there isn't a lot of data. Definitely not enough to see how ingrowth is affected by different cutting intensities. I'll start over and include plots that have only 4 measurements, to increase the amount of data we have to work with.
